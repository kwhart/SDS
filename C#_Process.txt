New Project
  .Net 5.0 (I chose console)

NuGet Packs:
   OSIsoft.OCS Client
   MS Extensions Configuration
   MS Extensions Configuration.Json

I didn't like the way StyleCop rules
 interfered so I removed it from the sample I worked with

AppSettings.json with my endpoints and settings

  {
  "Resource": "https://staging.osipi.com",
  "TenantId": "2f792c96-ebc4-45d6-bdea-539fcae8a6a1",
  "ClientId": "f8a0d905-11fa-45d0-b97a-97a2632c36b4",
  "ClientSecret": "KG+UfSMm3SYwYiT87/1yFg6yCYYm492WX9q5P9Hlr+A=",
  "ApiVersion": "v1"
}


Everything defaults to async calls
